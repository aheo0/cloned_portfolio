            <p>Project: 24 Hours to Die | Scratch</p>
            <p>Date: August 30 - September 27, 2018</p>
            <p>Course: Computer Science Principles</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>The object for our Scratch project was to create either a story 
            or a game with my partner, Josh Koh, that demonstrates our knowledge 
            of programming fundamentals and our ability to use the Scratch 
            interface. In the beginning, Josh and I concluded that we wanted to 
            create a story with user inputs—like a “Choose Your Own Adventure” 
            type. In our Scratch story code, we also displayed our creativity 
            with not only the story outline but with the effect we added to the 
            buttons the user clicks on to input their choice in between scenes. 
            Our button increases in size when the mouse cursor hovers above it. 
            Additionally our project intakes the username so that our characters 
            in our story can make humorous remarks at the user. A challenge we 
            were forced to overcome was the time constraint of the project. 
            Initially, we planned for many different paths the main character 
            could take, but as the due date of the project came closer, we 
            realized that we would need to somehow combine all our ideas in a 
            condensed scene. In the end, we did manage to include all of our 
            ideas that we had planned to include although our story could 
            definitely have been better given more time. I hope that in future 
            projects, our class would have more sufficient amount of time for us 
            to include all of our creativity. During the project, Josh and I 
            shared every work done which included the programming portion, the 
            background image creation, and the &#60link&#62Project 
            Notebook&#60/link&#62 where stored all of our information 
            professionally. Our Project Notebook includes our brainstorming, the 
            daily log of what Josh and I did, and the feedback we gained from 
            the gallery walk we did in class. Since the Project Notebook was 
            required, I felt at first it was some extra work. However at the end 
            of the project, the organization felt amazing to look over and now I 
            plan to create my own Project Notebook whenever I do a project in my 
            free time.</p>
